## array operations

1) Create a pokemonArray (there are other ways to do this but I like this one the most)

```js
const pokemonArray = [];
```

2) Add some pokemon you like using bracket notation and selecting an index

```js
pokemonArray[0] = 'pichu';
pokemonArray['1'] = 'eevee';
```

3) Add some pokemon you like using as many array methods you can think of

```js
pokemonArray.push('charmader');
pokemonArray.unshift('squirtle');
pokemonArray = pokemonArray.concat(['bulbasaur']);
pokemonArray.splice(1, 0, 'mew', 'mewTwo')
```

4) Access the first pokemon in your array using bracket notation
5) Access the second pokemon in your array  using bracket notation and a string
6) Access the rest of the pokemon in your array with as many array methods you can think of
```js
// pop
// shift
// splice
```
