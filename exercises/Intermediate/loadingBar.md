Lets work together on this one. I have a few ideas on how to make this one fairly simple at first and then ramp up the difficulty as we go on.

### steps

1) Build the html structure
2) Give it some style
3) Add the JS
  - I think a good way to start out is to only think about passing in a number and then using that number to animate the width.
  - What happens in this situation when you try to pass in a second number, how would you fix this?
  - When you hit 100%  (technically finished loading) how would you signal completion?

```js
class Loading {
  // what are some variables that are important for you to keep track or maybe provide?
  constructor() {
  }

  // The _addprogress method accepts a number then animates the width of an element
  _addProgress(n) {

  }
}
```
